Social Media has evolved significantly over the past decade helping mankind connect easily and rapidly. 
Every Technological Advances has its Merits and Demerits, similarly, Social Media has also created Positive and Negative Impact on individuals. 
Using the Logistic Regression model, we would be predicting the effect of Social Media on an individual.


Datasets gathered in the real-world setting often contain a large number of attributes that could be in hundreds or thousands. 
Performing analysis on such extensive datasets becomes a cumbersome task. If there 10 attributes, the correlation matrix to understand interrelationship will be 10 by 10, 
it becomes difficult to understand relationships with 10 variables, and as the number increases it becomes more difficult. 
Principal Component Analysis is a technique used to reduce the number of variables when there is a large number of variables in a dataset which helps perform analysis. 
The variables in such a dataset are often correlated and could be duplicate, PCA transforms these correlated variables into a significantly small number of uncorrelated variables. 
These transformed variables retain as much possible information from original variables. 
In PCA the original variables are transformed into a smaller set of linear combinations, which contains all the variance from the original variables.


Time Series Analysis plays an important role when it comes to predicting Electricity Consumption. 
This Time Series Analysis aims to predict the Electricity Supply, Transformation and Consumption for the Nation France for at least 4 months in advance. 
The analysis would help electricity generating and distributing companies to increase their efficiency and revenue by planning according to the requirement.
